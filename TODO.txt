Physics

	* level collisions

	* collision masks to define what things a body can interact with each other
		body.group = SHIP
		body.collides = SHIP|WALL|BULLET
		def add_body body
			@bodies << body
			@groups[body.type] << body
		end

	* collision callbacks to support things like 
		* pickups that do not modify the ship trajectory
		* sounds

	* proper support for collision with attachments

Networking

	* auto propagation of network registered models

Controls

	* some type of centralized controls

Questions

	* does mouse code really need to know w/h ?

	* why mouse grab gives me a few hundred fps more ???
