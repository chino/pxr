	* level collisions

	* collision masks to define what things a body can interact with each other
		body.group = SHIP
		body.collides = SHIP|WALL|BULLET
		def add_body body
			@bodies << body
			@groups[body.type] << body
		end

	* collision callbacks to support things like 
		* pickups that do not modify the ship trajectory
		* sounds

	* proper support for collision with attachments

	* allow objects to have gravity ?

Networking

	* auto propagation of network registered models

Controls

	* some type of centralized controls

Questions

	* does mouse code really need to know w/h ?

	* why mouse grab gives me a few hundred fps more ???

Rendering

	* proper frustum culling

	* bsp culling ?

Research

	http://rb-gsl.rubyforge.org/   The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a numerical library for C and C++ programmers.  The library provides a wide range of mathematical routines such as random number generators, special functions and least-squares fitting. There are over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite.    bunch of shit , some that caught my eye: Vectors, Matrices, Linear Algebra, interpolation, root-finding, least-squares-fitting, ieee floating point, discrete wavelet transforms, splines and more...

	http://narray.rubyforge.org/   NArray is an Numerical N-dimensional Array class. Supported element types are 1/2/4-byte Integer, single/double-precision Real/Complex, and Ruby Object. This extension library incorporates fast calculation and easy manipulation of large numerical arrays into the Ruby language. NArray has features similar to NumPy, but NArray has vector and matrix subclasses.

	http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-ftgl/   FTGL is a free cross-platform Open Source C++ library that uses Freetype2 to simplify rendering fonts in OpenGL applications. FTGL supports bitmaps, pixmaps, texture maps, outlines, polygon mesh, and extruded polygon rendering modes.

Spatial Partitioning

	I also read some other interesting notes in my book.
	One key point is that I can mix my grid with other type of spatial systems.
	Such as each grid cell having inside of it an octree, bsp tree, or some other system.
	These hybrid systems usually offer better mix in the end.

	using a bit mask to define which grid cell*S* a body is in.
	This way you can easily detect if two bodies are in the same cells 
	by doing an AND operation on both of their bit masks.
	This approach would remove the need to find neighbour cells because 
	items would be inserted in every cell they overlap.
	At that point it might even be easier to simply test every body 
	against every other body instead of continuously updating container 
	arrays ? It's something to think about.

	Also generating a time stamp for each collision sweep can allow us to tag 
	objects as being already tested within this "timestamp" test.

	Currently if I remember correctly I can still end up testing two spheres 
	against each other more than once.


(09:37:56 AM) meth: and i was thinking if you want the balls to have a timeout... they can blow up !!!
(09:38:45 AM) meth: maybe they can start like growing/shrinking rapidly and then collapse to a point like a black hole and explode !
(09:38:46 AM) meth: lol
(09:38:56 AM) meth: maybe a shock wave ?
(09:39:03 AM) meth: that would be cool
