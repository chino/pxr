Physics

	* level collisions
	* scene graph to make broad phase faster
	* function to generate radius from mesh geometry
	* different types of collision responses
		* would be nice to have proper inertia
		  so if i hit non moving objects we disperse velocity properly
	* collision masks to define what things a body can interact with each other
		body.group = SHIP
		body.collides = SHIP|WALL|BULLET
		def add_body body
			@bodies << body
			@groups[body.type] << body
		end
	* collision callbacks to support things like pickups that do not modify the ship trajectory
		body.collision = Proc.new {|target|
			target.add_power_up
			make_sound
			kill_pickup
			return false # no collision response
		}

Others

	More modular networking and rendering classes

	Auto propagation of network registered models.

Performance

	Allowing mouse grab gives me a few hundred fps more
