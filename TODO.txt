Physics

	* radian based mouse ? or set how much mouse can spin

	* level collisions

	* proper support for collision with attachments

	* allow objects to have gravity ?

	* if a pickup spawns on you since your both not moving you wont pick it up...

	* timestamp for each collision update
		so you know if two objects are already tested against each other

	* ruby-ode - class ?

UI

	* texting between players

	* console

Grphics

	* proper frustum culling

	* shaders

	* irrlicht shield affect

	* water ?

	* wave scenes

		- try using vertex arrays and index buffers?
		- try to create real looking water?
		- try rippling along the normal so you can have none flat surfaces ripple?
		- do normals have to be updated with the ripple?
		- using normal-mapping to create a ripple affect?

	* real time lighting for descent levels

Levels

	* simple node based tunnels (perhaps use nurbs for smooth path)

Network

	* detect if a player drops out of teh game

Game Logic

	* add timeout for balls , make them blow up ?  maybe they can start like growing/shrinking
		rapidly and then collapse to a point like a black hole and explode !
		maybe make a shock wave too ?

	* ability to tag graphity on things

	* tesselate models

	* console api which is also used in config ?

Deployment

	* single packed binaries for windows ?

Game Modes

	* first simple kill based game

	* asteriods

	* mario cart

Controls

	* define a ForsakenBike class for movement style...

	* support sdl joystick

Questions

	* does mouse code really need to know w/h ?

	* why mouse grab gives me a few hundred fps more ???

Research

	http://rb-gsl.rubyforge.org/   The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a numerical library for C and C++ programmers.  The library provides a wide range of mathematical routines such as random number generators, special functions and least-squares fitting. There are over 1000 functions in total with an extensive test suite.    bunch of shit , some that caught my eye: Vectors, Matrices, Linear Algebra, interpolation, root-finding, least-squares-fitting, ieee floating point, discrete wavelet transforms, splines and more...

	http://narray.rubyforge.org/   NArray is an Numerical N-dimensional Array class. Supported element types are 1/2/4-byte Integer, single/double-precision Real/Complex, and Ruby Object. This extension library incorporates fast calculation and easy manipulation of large numerical arrays into the Ruby language. NArray has features similar to NumPy, but NArray has vector and matrix subclasses.

	http://rubyforge.org/projects/ruby-ftgl/   FTGL is a free cross-platform Open Source C++ library that uses Freetype2 to simplify rendering fonts in OpenGL applications. FTGL supports bitmaps, pixmaps, texture maps, outlines, polygon mesh, and extruded polygon rendering modes.

	http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/~paxton/tioga.html  might be of interest ... i think it has a latex wrapper .. idk...
