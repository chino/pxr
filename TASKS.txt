IDEAS

	shaders
	ripples
		- try using vertex arrays and index buffers?
		- try to create real looking water?
		- try rippling along the normal so you can have none flat surfaces ripple?
		- do normals have to be updated with the ripple?
		- using normal-mapping to create a ripple affect?
	networking
		- new connections
			- need to support storing list of clients that connect
			- and some kind of timeout if no updates are received
			- send to all connected clients
